Subclass? Compostition? TODO!!!



    If you would prefer to use a different name, you could create a subclass of
    :InstanceProperty and override :__set_name.

    If you would prefer to store the delegated property in a completely
    different way, you should create a delegated property storage strategy class
    and pass in an instance to the keyword argument `delegate_storage`.
